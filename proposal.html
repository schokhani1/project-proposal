    <h1>What is your website about?</h1>
    <p>
        My website is going to be about my company Breaking Dough. I started this company last year as a forward vertical of my family business.
        As my family business is manufacturing and selling retail bakery products, I used those products to create finished goods. My website is basically going to highlight 
        the products sold, their description, ingredients and the procedure to make them. </p>

    <h1> What is the objective of your webiste?</h1>
    <p>
        One of the main reason I joined this class was because of my business. This is the perfect opportunity for me to learn from this class and implement the teachings towards my business.
        This website will be the opportunity for me to give my employees and customers a detailed view on the website products and the receipes. I also would loev to highlight the company progress through this website and a roadmap for the future.
        I also plan to convert this into a selling platform one day as my company does not have a full proof website right now.
